TryHackMe: Tempest – Incident Response Capstone

A complete hands-on incident response simulation based on the [TryHackMe Tempest Incident Response Capstone](https://tryhackme.com/room/tempestincident). This challenge mimics a realistic enterprise compromise. Below is a structured breakdown of my experience, the challenges faced, and how I solved them.

| 8    | Privilege Escalation                | Discovering SYSTEM access via token impersonation       |
| 9    | Fully-Owned Machine                 | Tracing data exfiltration and final attacker objectives |


Executive Summary

This room challenged me to follow an attacker’s full kill chain from initial access to exfiltration. Tasks were designed to simulate real SOC investigations including:

Malware analysis
Endpoint and network log triage
Lateral movement tracing
Privilege escalation detection
Command & Control (C2) analysis

Detailed Breakdown by Task

Task 1: Introduction

Overview: Briefed on a suspicious internal and external incident.
Goal: Understand the attacker’s campaign structure and prepare for IR steps.

\Task 2: Log Analysis

Tools: Syslog, EVTX logs, Zeek
Key Events: Login failures, lateral movement markers, Event IDs 4624, 4688

Task 3: Tool Mapping

Network: Wireshark, Zeek
Log Review: EventLog Explorer, Notepad++
Malware: CyberChef, strings, Any.Run

Task 4: Malicious Document

Tool Used: olevba from oletools
Finding: Embedded VBA macro downloading a dropper

Task 5: Stage 2 Execution

Activity: PowerShell backdoor captured in outbound traffic
Decoded With: CyberChef

Task 6: Malicious Traffic

Indicators: DNS requests, base64 GET parameters
Pattern: Periodic beaconing to `resolvecyber.xyz`

Task 7: Internal Recon

PowerShell Cmdlets: `net view`, `Get-ADUser`, `ping`
Log Source: Event ID 4104

Task 8: Privilege Escalation

Method: Token impersonation
Detection: Event ID 4672 + `whoami /groups`
Mitigation: Enable LSA Protection

Task 9: Actions on Objectives

Exfil Method: FTP + HTTP POST
Evidence: Base64-encoded archives


C2 Encoding Example

Observed Traffic:  GET /9ab626b5?q=dh2nVHlpICtgGd0VtcGVzdFxiZw5pbWFydGQK


Decoded:  echo 'dh2nVHlpICtgGd0VtcGVzdFxiZw5pbWFydGQK' | base64 -d

Output: `v...TestFiz...ward`

Tools & Techniques

Logs: Event Viewer, EventLog Explorer, SysmonView, EvtxECmd
Network: Wireshark, Zeek, Brim, tcpdump

Conclusion

This project simulated an enterprise-scale compromise. It improved my:

Triage of endpoint and network logs
Skill decoding and analyzing real C2 payloads
Understanding of attacker tactics
Readiness for Tier 1/2 SOC and Incident Response roles
